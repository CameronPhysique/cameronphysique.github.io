I have always used website builders in the past, so after learning how HTML and CSS I wanted a project to dive straight into. I had recently built my website using clickfunnels as I wanted to implement funnels in a simple way. This was great but the monthly fee not so, as I have understanding of the clickfunnels software and the process of funnels. I decided to replicate what I had built with a web-builder using html and css. 

This is my first real project since completing the responsive website design course from FreeCodeCamp. I'm lerning JavaScript now and will add this into my project as I develop new skills. 

I'm a very creative person in general and have come from a digital marketing background so have a keen eye for design. I'm hoping to further develop my technical skills and continue to learn new languages.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my project, I'm very open to networking. 

Please reach out with any and all feedback.

Thank you

Cameron
