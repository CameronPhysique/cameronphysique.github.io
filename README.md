This is my first real project since completing the responsive website design course from FreeCodeCamp. I'm lerning JavaScript now and will add this into my project as I develop new skills. 

I'm a very creative person in general and have come from a digital marketing background so have a keen eye for design. I'm hoping to further develop my technical skills and continue to learn new languages.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my project, I'm very open to networking. 

Please reach out with any and all feedback.

Thank you

Cameron
